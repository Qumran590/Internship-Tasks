# Internship-Tasks
Internship Tasks- Term Deposit Subscription Prediction, Customer segmentation using Unsupervised learning, Energy Consumption time series Forecasting.
This repository contains my work during the Data Science & AI/ML internship. It includes three main tasks, covering supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and time series forecasting.

üè¶ Task 1 ‚Äî Bank Marketing Prediction
Goal: Predict whether a customer subscribes to a term deposit after a marketing campaign.
Dataset: Bank Marketing dataset (UCI).
Steps:
Data cleaning & preprocessing (encoding categorical features, handling imbalance).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
Trained models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.
Model evaluation using accuracy, F1-score, ROC AUC.
Explainability with SHAP & LIME.
Result: Best-performing model identified with feature importance and prediction explanations.

üë• Task 2 ‚Äî Customer Segmentation
Goal: Group customers into segments based on income and spending behavior for targeted marketing.
Dataset: Mall Customers dataset.
Steps:
Data preparation and scaling.
K-Means clustering with Elbow & Silhouette methods.
Cluster visualization using PCA.
Cluster profiling (age, income, spending).
Result: Clear customer segments defined with suggested marketing strategies.

‚ö° Task 3 ‚Äî Energy Consumption Forecasting
Goal: Forecast household electricity usage.
Dataset: Household Power Consumption dataset.
Steps:
Time-series preprocessing (datetime parsing, resampling).
Feature engineering (lags, rolling statistics, time-based features).
Models: ARIMA, Prophet, XGBoost.
Evaluation with MAE & RMSE.
Visualization of actual vs predicted usage.
Result: Compared models to recommend the best forecasting approach.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech & Skills Learned
